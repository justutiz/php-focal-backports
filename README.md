> [!IMPORTANT]
> These packages include the fixes for **CVE-2026-109618** and **CVE-2026-109619**, two critical (CVSS 9.2) unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerabilities in PHP, published on 2026-10-21. See the [PHP advisory](https://www.php.net/archive/2026.php#2026-10-21-5).

## Why this exists

The [ondrej/php](https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/ubuntu/php) PPA applied the fixes to every PHP version it maintains, **but it no longer publishes packages for Ubuntu 20.04**. Servers still on Ubuntu 20.04 with PHP from that PPA have no patched package to install.

This repository takes the patched Ubuntu 22.04 source packages from the PPA and rebuilds them, unchanged, on Ubuntu 20.04. Only the version number changes. Because they are based on the latest sources, the packages also include every security fix the PPA released after it stopped publishing for Ubuntu 20.04.

## Available versions

| PHP | Package version | Based on |
|:---:|---|---|
| **8.1** | `8.1.34-9+ubuntu20.04.1+backport1` | `8.1.34-9` |
| **8.0** | `1:8.0.30-25+ubuntu20.04.1+backport1` | `1:8.0.30-25` |
| **7.4** | `1:7.4.33-31+ubuntu20.04.1+backport1` | `1:7.4.33-31` |
| **7.3** | `7.3.33-35+ubuntu20.04.1+backport1` | `7.3.33-35` |
| **5.6** | `5.6.40-104+ubuntu20.04.1+backport1` | `5.6.40-104` |

"Based on" is the ondrej/php source package for Ubuntu 22.04.

## Quick start

On an Ubuntu 20.04 amd64 server with PHP 8.1 from the ondrej/php PPA (replace `8.1` with your version):

```bash
V=8.1
curl -LO "https://github.com/nanoarmando/php-focal-backports/releases/latest/download/php${V}-focal-amd64.tar.gz"
curl -LO "https://github.com/nanoarmando/php-focal-backports/releases/latest/download/SHA256SUMS"
sha256sum --check --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS

mkdir "php${V}" && tar -xzf "php${V}-focal-amd64.tar.gz" -C "php${V}" && cd "php${V}"
installed=$(dpkg-query -W -f='${Package} ${Status}\n' "php${V}*" "libapache2-mod-php${V}" "libphp${V}-embed" 2>/dev/null | awk '/ installed$/{print $1}')
sudo dpkg -i $(for p in $installed; do ls "${p}"_*.deb; done)

sudo systemctl restart "php${V}-fpm"
dpkg -s "php${V}-common" | grep Version   # must end in +backport1
```

The commands upgrade **only the packages that are already installed**. Read [Installation](#installation) for the details and the rollback steps.

## Installation

### Requirements

| Check | Command | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| Ubuntu release | `lsb_release -ds` | `Ubuntu 20.04.x LTS` |
| Architecture | `uname -m` | `x86_64` |
| PHP origin | `dpkg -l 'php*' \| awk '/^ii/{print $2, $3}'` | versions ending in `+deb.sury.org+1` (ondrej/php), or Ubuntu's own `php7.4` |

### Steps

1. **Back up the current packages**, so you can roll back:

   ```bash
   V=8.1
   sudo apt-get install --download-only --reinstall $(dpkg-query -W -f='${Package}=${Version} ' "php${V}*")
   ```

   If `apt` can no longer download your installed version, rebuild the `.deb` files from the installed packages with `dpkg-repack` instead.

2. **Download and verify** the archive for your version, as shown in [Quick start](#quick-start).

3. **Install only the packages already present.** Installing every `.deb` in the archive would pull in dependencies you do not need, such as Firebird or SNMP libraries.

4. **Restart the services** that run PHP:

   | Your setup | Command |
   |---|---|
   | PHP-FPM (Apache or Nginx) | `sudo systemctl restart php8.1-fpm` |
   | Apache with `mod_php` | `sudo systemctl restart apache2` |

5. **Verify** that `dpkg -s php8.1-common | grep Version` ends in `+backport1`.

Repeat the steps for every PHP version installed on the server.

> [!TIP]
> Extensions shipped as separate packages, such as `imagick`, `redis`, `memcached` or `xdebug`, keep working after the upgrade. They depend on the PHP API version (for example `phpapi-20210902` for 8.1), which does not change within a minor release.

<details>
<summary><strong>Replacing Ubuntu's own php7.4</strong></summary>

<br>

Ubuntu 20.04 ships its own `php7.4` packages, with versions like `7.4.3-4ubuntu2.x`. The `php7.4` packages from this repository replace them with the same steps:

- The epoch (`1:`) makes `dpkg` treat them as an upgrade.
- Ubuntu's `php-common` (`2:75`) satisfies their `php-common (>= 1:81~)` dependency.

After the upgrade, the server runs PHP 7.4 from these rebuilds and keeps Ubuntu's `php-common` and metapackages such as `php-xml` or `php-mbstring`.

<summary><strong>Rolling back</strong></summary>

Reinstall the packages saved in step 1 and restart PHP:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i /var/cache/apt/archives/php8.1*.deb
sudo systemctl restart php8.1-fpm
```

</details>

## Included packages

Each archive contains the same binary packages that the ondrej/php PPA builds from that source.

**Runtimes and SAPIs**

`phpX.Y` (metapackage) · `phpX.Y-cli` · `phpX.Y-fpm` · `phpX.Y-cgi` · `libapache2-mod-phpX.Y` · `phpX.Y-phpdbg` · `libphpX.Y-embed` · `phpX.Y-litespeed` · `phpX.Y-common` · `phpX.Y-dev`

**Extensions in every version**

`bcmath` · `bz2` · `curl` · `dba` · `enchant` · `gd` · `gmp` · `imap` · `interbase` · `intl` · `ldap` · `mbstring` · `mysql` · `odbc` · `opcache` · `pgsql` · `pspell` · `readline` · `snmp` · `soap` · `sqlite3` · `sybase` · `tidy` · `xml` · `xsl` · `zip`

**Extensions only in some versions**

| Extension | 8.1 | 8.0 | 7.4 | 7.3 | 5.6 |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `json` | built-in | built-in | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `xmlrpc` | | | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `recode` | | | | ✓ | ✓ |
| `mcrypt` | | | | | ✓ |

Extensions maintained as separate source packages (`imagick`, `redis`, `memcached`, `xdebug`, `mongodb`, and others) are **not** included.

## How the packages are built

Everything runs on GitHub Actions ([`build.yml`](.github/workflows/build.yml)), on every push to `main` and on manual dispatch:

1. **Build**: for each PHP version, [`build.sh`](build.sh) runs inside an `ubuntu:20.04` container. It downloads the Ubuntu 22.04 source package from Launchpad, installs the build dependencies from the Ubuntu 20.04 archive, sets the new version with a `+backport1` suffix, and builds the packages with `dpkg-buildpackage` (without the upstream test suite).
2. **Release**: packs each version into `phpX.Y-focal-amd64.tar.gz` with a `SHA256SUMS` file inside, writes a top-level `SHA256SUMS`, and publishes everything to the release.

The full build log of every release is public in the [Actions](https://github.com/nanoarmando/php-focal-backports/actions) tab.

## Limitations

> [!WARNING]
> - **Ubuntu 20.04, amd64 only.** A `.deb` links against the libraries of the release it was built on, so these packages do not install on other releases. Ubuntu 22.04 and later receive patched packages through `apt`, from Ubuntu or from the ondrej/php PPA.
> - **Unofficial.** These are third-party rebuilds of upstream sources, without the PPA's signatures. Review the workflow and verify the checksums before installing.
> - **A stopgap.** Ubuntu 20.04 and PHP 8.1 and older no longer receive regular security support. Plan the move to a supported Ubuntu release and PHP version.
